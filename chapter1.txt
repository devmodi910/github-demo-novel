Evelyn’s fingers gently traced the edges of the ancient parchment. The map had been hidden away in a dusty corner of a small library in a remote town. She had stumbled upon it while researching an obscure myth of a city that vanished long ago. The map was unlike any she had seen before, its lines faded with age, and symbols that seemed to pulse with an eerie energy.

As she unfolded the map, a cold shiver ran down her spine. The city depicted on it was not marked on any modern maps. It was a place where time had forgotten itself, hidden deep within the mountains of the forgotten east.

“Could it really exist?” she whispered to herself.
