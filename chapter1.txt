Evelyn’s fingers gently traced the edges of the ancient parchment. The map had been hidden away in a dusty corner of a small library in a remote town. She had stumbled upon it while researching an obscure myth of a city that vanished long ago. The map was unlike any she had seen before, its lines faded with age, and symbols that seemed to pulse with an eerie energy.

As she unfolded the map, a cold shiver ran down her spine. The city depicted on it was not marked on any modern maps. It was a place where time had forgotten itself, hidden deep within the mountains of the forgotten east.

“Could it really exist?” she whispered to herself.

Determined to find the truth, Evelyn packed her bags with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. She knew that this journey would not be easy. The road to the forgotten city would be treacherous, and many had tried to find it and failed. But Evelyn was resolute. The thrill of discovery called to her like a siren’s song.
