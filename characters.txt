Evelyn Hart was not your average adventurer. She was a quiet, introspective historian who spent her days researching ancient texts and artifacts. A woman in her late twenties, with long auburn hair and glasses perched on the tip of her nose, she had an uncanny ability to decipher forgotten languages. Yet, despite her scholarly pursuits, there was something about the way she viewed the world that spoke of deep curiosity, a thirst for knowledge, and an undying sense of wonder. When she discovered a hidden map, ancient and fragile, detailing a forgotten city lost to time, it ignited a fire in her — a fire that would change her life forever.
